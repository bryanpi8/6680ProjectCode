'''
TX-RX Metrics
1. Shortest Path

    Definition: The shortest path is the minimum number of edges (or the minimum total weight in a weighted graph) between two nodes.
    Interpretation: This measures how "close" two nodes are within the network. A shorter path suggests a more direct relationship or connection between the two nodes.
    Application: In a communication network, it could represent the minimum number of hops between two computers or devices.

3. Effective Resistance (Electrical Distance)

    Definition: The effective resistance between two nodes is derived from treating the network as an electrical circuit where edges represent resistors. The metric reflects how easily current (or information) can flow between two nodes.
    Interpretation: Lower effective resistance indicates a stronger, more direct connection between the nodes. This metric considers all possible paths between two nodes, not just the shortest one.
    Application: This is useful in evaluating redundancy, since multiple paths between two nodes reduce the resistance.

8. Number of Disjoint Paths (Edge/Node Disjoint)

    Definition: The number of disjoint paths between two nodes counts the number of paths between them that donâ€™t share any edges or nodes.
    Interpretation: This indicates how many independent ways two nodes can communicate. More disjoint paths mean higher fault tolerance or redundancy in the connection between the two nodes.
    Application: In a computer network, multiple disjoint paths ensure that communication between two devices can continue even if some connections fail.

Network Metrics
1. Network Density

    Definition: The ratio of the number of actual edges to the number of possible edges in the network. In weighted networks, density can be adapted to consider the total weight of all edges relative to the maximum possible weight.
    Interpretation: In a computer network, density measures how interconnected the network is. High density means most computers are directly connected, while low density indicates a sparse network.
    Impact: High-density networks are typically more robust and fault-tolerant, as there are more alternative paths available for communication. However, very dense networks may suffer from increased overhead or congestion.

2. Average Weighted Path Length

    Definition: The average of the shortest weighted paths between all pairs of nodes in the network. The weights represent costs, such as distance, bandwidth, or latency.
    Interpretation: This reflects the average efficiency of communication across the network, considering the costs associated with each link.
    Impact: Shorter average path lengths indicate a more efficient network, where communication can occur quickly and at lower cost. Longer paths suggest potential latency issues or inefficiencies.

Average Weighted Path Length=1N(Nâˆ’1)2âˆ‘iâ‰ jdij
Average Weighted Path Length=2N(Nâˆ’1)â€‹1â€‹iî€ =jâˆ‘â€‹dijâ€‹

where dijdijâ€‹ is the weighted shortest path between nodes ii and jj.

3. Network Diameter (Weighted)

    Definition: The longest shortest weighted path between any two nodes in the network.
    Interpretation: In a computer network, the diameter reflects the worst-case scenario for communication delay or cost. A smaller diameter indicates that even the most distant nodes can communicate efficiently, while a larger diameter may signal potential bottlenecks.
    Impact: Networks with smaller diameters are better connected and have lower latency for communication between distant parts.

7. Network Robustness (Weighted Connectivity)

    Definition: A measure of how resilient the network is to node or edge failures, considering the weights of edges. This can include metrics like weighted node connectivity (the minimum number of nodes that need to be removed to disconnect the network) and weighted edge connectivity (the minimum number of edges that need to be removed).
    Interpretation: In a communication network, higher robustness means the network can withstand failures without major disruptions. Networks with higher connectivity tend to have redundant paths that help maintain communication even if certain links or nodes fail.
    Impact: Robust networks are fault-tolerant and ensure reliable communication, even in the face of failures or attacks.
